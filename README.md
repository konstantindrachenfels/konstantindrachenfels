- 👋 Hi, I’m @konstantindrachenfels

- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis. Especially, in empowering people with the smart use of data. I want to help to shape processes clearer, leaner and less complexe while  
- improving the quality of information that is provided to people along the way. I want to help companies to capitalize the available data to provide it to the right people
- in the organization at the right time and in the right format to help them to draw the right conclusions and be better at their job.

- 🌱 I specialized in business analysis during my Masters in Management studies learning the basics of data collection, cleaning, analysis and viualization. 
- I also took introductory courses in artificial intelligence. Along the way I acquired a basic knowledge in SQL, VBA, Tableau, Java Script, Figma, IBM Watson and GitHub
- and a more in-depth knowledge in R and Python including libraries used for machine and deep learning.  

- I’m currently learning mobile app development associated to my startup project. There, I managed to co-develop an MVP with the no-code plattform bubble.io and am currently
- looking to gain more insights into mobile app development with GitLab, Flutter and Firebase to understand what our development team is doing.

- 💞️ I’m generally interested in opportunities in data analysis which enable me to do what I have described in the first paragraph.
